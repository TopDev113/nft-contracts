 * Tests for the NFTFactory:
 * - Factory can deploy itself, and then create new NFTs successfully
 * - Deployed shared implementation has all the values set to zero
 * - Deployed NFTs have correct owner and correct values
 * - Updating value in one NFT doesn't change value in other, or in the shared implementation
 * - Shared implementation fails on all transactions
 * - Test simple sale for deployed NFTs
 * - Test that deployed NFTs have different owners
