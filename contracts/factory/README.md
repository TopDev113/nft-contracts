# NFTFactory

The architecture works as follows:

- NFTFactory is a base contract that manages the creation of NFTs. It takes small fee (about 500k gas * basefee) to create a new NFT smart-contract.
- SharedImplementationNFT is a base NFT sale contract. It can mint NFTs and allows other contracts to connect to it for minting
- INFTExtension is an interface that is allowed to connect to SharedImplementationNFT and mint on their behalf


## NFTFactory

Pay a fee to create a new NFT smart-contract.

NFTFactory.createNFT is MUCH cheaper than deploying your own smart-contract.

Usual ERC721 deployment varies from 3m to 5m gas.

NFTFactory.createNFT eats about 300k gas, 10-20x cheaper.


## SharedImplementationNFT

This is a clone-able version of `contracts/AvatarNFT.sol`. It's a fixed-supply ERC721 minter. You can set price and other misc params for the public sale.

Note: While it says `ERC721Upgradeable`, it's not. We use this version of OpenZeppelin contracts, because we need to be able to `Clone` the contract.


## INFTExtension

This one is a cherry on top of this architecture! It's a contract that can be connected to SharedImplementationNFT and mint on their behalf.

The main idea here is that `INFTExtension` is a stateless contract. The state should be stored in the `SharedImplementationNFT` contract.

This is meant to reduce deployment cost as much as possible. Extensions are meant to be deployed once and be available to use for every `SharedImplementationNFT` instance who wants to connect them.

Examples of state stored in the original contract would be:
- Tier info
- Sale price
- LastTokenId counter

However, sometimes you might need additional data in the extension, say, on-chain art. Then you would store this data in extension contract, but mapped by original NFT collection address.

Example:

```solidity
interface INFT is IERC721 {
    function getArt(address _collectionAddress) public view returns (bytes32);
}

contract Extension is INFTExtension {
    mapping (INFT => uint256) public ;
}
```

## How to connect extension to SharedImplementationNFT

Basically there are three options to connect extension to SharedImplementationNFT.

NFTSale <=> ExtensionA
        <=> ExtensionB


1. Send token data to SharedImplementationNFT directly. Store extension data in SharedImplementationNFT.

```solidity
function mint(uint nTokens, bytes32[] data) {

    for (uint i; i < nTokens; i++) {
        tokenId = _tokenIdCounter + i;
        _tokenData[tokenId] = data[i];
    }

    _tokenIdCounter += nTokens;
}
```

+ no need to keep track in Extension, which tokenIds were minted
- can't control which tokenIds are being issued, only issued sequentially


2. SharedImplementationNFT accepts tokenIds data from outside and doesn't store lastTokenId

```solidity
function mint(uint[] tokenIds) {
    for (uint i; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        _safeMint(tokenIds[i]);
    }
}
```

+ control over tokenIds
+ can issue different sequences of tokenId, e.g. 0-100 separate from 1000-1100
- extension needs to store tokenIdCounter for each collection

3. SharedImplementationNFT accepts tokenIds data from outside, but also stores lastTokenId as a public value

```solidity
function lastTokenId () {
    return _tokenIdCounter;
}

function mint(uint[] tokenIds) {
    for (uint i; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        _safeMint(tokenIds[i]);
    }
}
```



Usecases:

1. Sale 10k NFT avatars. Sell tokenIds sequentially, fixed price. Also allocate X tokens to owner (claimReserved)
2. Sell 5-10 NFT on your website. Can be minted by owner, or bought at fixed price, different for each token. Can mint new tokens in the collection.
3. Tiered 10k sale. Different amounts of different tokens, some can be minted by owner, others are sold publicly at the same price inside tier. 0-99: 1 ETH, 100-9999: 0.1 ETH, 1000-9999: 0.05 ETH;
4. LazyMint â€“ different price for different tokenIds, but signed by owner, not on-chain before minting.
5. On-chain art. Replace URI with base64-encoded json and image.
6. ERC1155 Factory?
